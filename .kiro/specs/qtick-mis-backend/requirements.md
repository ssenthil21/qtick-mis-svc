# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The QTick MIS Backend is a Spring Boot Java 21 REST API service that will replace sample data in the QTick MIS dashboard with real APIs. The system integrates with MySQL as the system-of-record and MongoDB for activity timelines and analytics snapshots. The backend serves four main UI pages: Dashboard, Sales Pipeline, Client Management, and Analytics, supporting multi-tenant operations with role-based access control.

4. WHEN a user requests client bills THEN the system SHALL return paginated bill headers with items and payments
5. WHEN a user requests client appointments THEN the system SHALL return past and upcoming appointments
6. WHEN a user requests client services THEN the system SHALL return owned and frequently used services
7. WHEN a user requests client points THEN the system SHALL return loyalty ledger and current balance
8. WHEN a user requests client devices THEN the system SHALL return app/device footprint and last login information

### Requirement 4: Analytics and Reporting

**User Story:** As an analyst, I want to access comprehensive business analytics and reports, so that I can analyze performance trends and generate insights for business improvement.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests KPI analytics THEN the system SHALL return aggregate metrics for the selected period with comparison deltas
2. WHEN a user requests service analytics THEN the system SHALL return service-level data including revenue, jobs, mix, and year-over-year comparisons
3. WHEN a user requests staff analytics THEN the system SHALL return staff performance including revenue, jobs, utilization, and average ratings
4. WHEN a user requests funnel analytics THEN the system SHALL return lead conversion rates, stage-to-stage progression, win rates, and cycle times
5. WHEN a user requests marketing analytics THEN the system SHALL return campaign performance including uptake, bookings, revenue, and ROI
6. WHEN a user requests retention analytics THEN the system SHALL return visit cohorts, returning customer rates, and lifecycle analysis
7. IF analytics data matches BOH SQL THEN the system SHALL ensure accuracy within Â±0.5% variance

### Requirement 5: Authentication and Authorization

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to control user access based on roles and tenant boundaries, so that data security and privacy are maintained across different business entities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user authenticates THEN the system SHALL validate JWT tokens with RS256 signature and extract claims for sub, roles, bizId, branchIds, and userId
